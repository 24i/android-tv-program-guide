===========

### 2019-12-20

* Fixed a crash in the demo, which was because of a missing `AndroidThreeTen.init()`.
* Fixed a crash in the library which happened when restoring the program guide from the view saved states (`ClassNotFoundException: androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView$SavedState`).
